This demo present key part for Hedera flow scheduling algorithm - demand estimate. As actual network flow possesses similar but more complex factor for demand, this demo only implement algorithm in theoretical data given in Hedera paper.

Usage:
- Open eslipse (or other Java complier)
- Make sure src folder contains Flow.java, Host.java, Main.java and Scheduler.java
- Run Main.java

Result:
The output result should be in command line style, which looks similar to the final matrix present in Hedera paper (Figure 4)

Miscellaneous:
The output has 1 data which does not converge according to this demo(but converge in Figure 4 in Hedera paper)
